# Recreate-LoDash_Project

This is a **[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) Web Development Path JavaScrit [Project](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/web-dev-js-arrays-loops-objects/modules/pjs-javascript-capstone/projects/lodash)**.

In this Project, I was asked to recreate a (tiny) fraction of the **[LoDash Lybrary](https://lodash.com/)**.

To do this, I had to work with **JS Objects** and **Object Methods**.

I tried to keep my code as simple and semantically significant as possible, and I enjoyed solving these quite a lot :)
